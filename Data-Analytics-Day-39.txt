Topics & Explanations

1. Data Storytelling with Visuals
=================================
Data isn’t just about numbers — it’s about telling a story that influences decisions.

Example: Instead of showing a raw sales table, build a trend line with annotations showing how a new campaign boosted revenue.


2. Choosing the Right Chart Type
===============================
Line chart → for trends over time.
Bar chart → for comparing categories.
Heatmap → for spotting intensity/patterns.

Example: A heatmap of sales by region & month instantly highlights peak seasons.


3. Interactive Dashboards
=========================
Interactive dashboards in Power BI/Tableau let users explore data themselves.

Example: A retail manager can filter by product category and instantly see sales impact across locations.


4. Data-Driven Business Decisions
================================
Data insights must connect to actionable outcomes.

Example: If data shows 40% cart abandonment on mobile, the business can invest in improving the checkout flow.


5. Case Study – Marketing Campaign Analysis
========================================
Campaign launched → Collect click, conversion, and ROI data.
Use visual storytelling → Show ROI uplift with interactive dashboards.

Example: A marketing manager used Tableau to reveal that email campaigns had 2× ROI vs social ads, influencing budget allocation.
